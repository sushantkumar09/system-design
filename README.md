# Low Level System Design (LLD)

This repository contains **low-level system design implementations** written to strengthen **object-oriented design, design patterns, and coding for scalable systems**.

The goal is to bridge the gap between **design thinking** and **clean, production-ready code**, as expected in **SDE / Backend / System Design interviews**.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

- Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles  
- SOLID principles  
- Design Patterns (Creational, Structural, Behavioral)  
- Clean Code & Separation of Concerns  
- Extensible and testable designs  
- Interview-focused low-level system problems  

All designs focus on:
- Clear **class responsibilities**
- Proper **abstractions & interfaces**
- **Scalability & extensibility**
- Minimal coupling, high cohesion

---

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

- Practice **real interview-style LLD problems**
- Convert **UML / design discussions → working code**
- Improve ability to explain **design decisions**
- Build confidence for **backend & system design rounds**
